# ${1:MUChat}
 
a typical music streaming app with a unique feature .....chat with the listeners, share your feelings about
the music or....just flirt, it's up to you. 
 
## Installation
Installation process and documentation are coming soon...( well not too soon, actually  depends on my mood.......being a lazy and ambivalent person I still don't know, if I'm gonna continue this project in future or not  ;) )
If you are too eager then google it.It's not that hard, if a novice like me can do it than anybody can....kudos to you.

## BTW
Message for those magnanimous persons who are thinking to fork it and understand it (if there any)......
Please don't find me and kill me(i am sorry for my childish coding, naming conventions, coding without comments...basically for everything...)
